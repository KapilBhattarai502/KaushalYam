This platform facilitates seamless connectivity between patients and hospital administrations, 
offering a range of services aimed at enhancing the overall healthcare experience. 
Patients can utilize Kaushalyam to book appointments, access and view test reports, and in future enhancements,
automate test processes, facilitate consultation fee payments through affiliated hospitals, and access health awareness videos.
Upon signing in, hospital administrators gain access to an admin page that provides an overview of the system's core functionalities.
This includes the ability to manage user information through the user table, oversee doctor details via the doctors table,

This comprehensive schema enables efficient organization and management of doctor information, ensuring accurate scheduling and patient care coordination.
